# CleanNoise_GF3
Repository for GF3 IIA project 2020 May - June (CUED 3rd year project)

## Main code
Currently the "main" code which includes both the transmitter (generating the sequence) and receiver is found in the CleanNoise Audio Modem jupyter notebook. A jupyter notebook format works better for the final testing of each teams' modem interoperability, as niche differences will require certain cells to be modified. 

Following the end of the project, it is likely that the main code will be further organised in a .py file. 

## Reference code
The main code runs a sequence of commands that are referred from the number of .py files in the same directory as the main jupyter notebook files. Each python file includes functions that are necessary for the Audio modem. Some functionalities are kept within the main function in order for fine tuning and debugging to be possible.
